/**
 * @file Opengist session-sharing provider.
 *
 * Uploads the exported session HTML to a **self-hosted Opengist** instance
 * (https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist) instead of GitHub Gists, so you can
 * keep shared sessions on your own infrastructure (e.g. `gist.l3x.in`).
 *
 * Why a dedicated provider (and not just an `apiUrl` swap on the GitHub one):
 * - **Route:** Opengist's REST API lives under `/api/` — the create endpoint is
 *   `POST <instance>/api/gists` (GitHub's is `POST api.github.com/gists`). The
 *   prior assumption that it was `/api/v1/gists` was wrong; `/api/v1` 404s.
 * - **Body:** Opengist uses a `visibility` string (`public` | `unlisted` |
 *   `private`) where GitHub uses a `public` boolean, and accepts a `title`
 *   field. The `files` map shape (`{ name: { content } }`) happens to match
 *   GitHub's, but the rest of the contract differs.
 * - **Auth:** an Opengist access token (`og_…`) with the `gist:write` scope,
 *   sent as `Authorization: Bearer og_…` — not a GitHub PAT.
 * - **Viewer:** the pi.dev viewer hardcodes `api.github.com`, so it can't read
 *   an Opengist gist. By default we therefore point `shareUrl` at the gist's
 *   **raw** web route: the exported HTML is self-contained (session data
 *   inline), and Opengist serves `.html` files with `Content-Type: text/html`
 *   and an `inline` disposition (no restrictive CSP for HTML — only SVG/PDF
 *   get one), so the raw URL renders the full session in any browser with no
 *   viewer dependency. When `PI_SHARE_VIEWER_URL` points at a **non-pi.dev**
 *   viewer (e.g. `gistviewer.l3x.in`), the `shareUrl` is instead built as
 *   `<viewer>#<gistPageUrl>` — a self-hosted viewer that fetches the gist by
 *   URL can render Opengist sessions the same way pi.dev renders GitHub ones.
 *   See https://opengist.io/docs for the API reference.

  // renders on `pi.dev`, an origin isolated from where gists are stored — this
  // raw link is served from the **same origin** as the Opengist app the viewer
  // is logged into. The exported HTML carries the viewer JS plus rendered tool
  // output / file contents, so anything that isn't escaped by the session
  // exporter runs with the Opengist origin's privileges (cookies, authenticated
